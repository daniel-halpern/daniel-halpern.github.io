Hello! I am a second-year student computer science specialist plus math minor at the University of Toronto. I enjoy working on highly technical projects, especially those involving computer vision (CV), machine learning (ML), and signal processing.

Much of my work focuses on extracting and interpreting information from various inputs, including visual and temporal data. I've developed analysis software for single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, built CV systems for wave detection and lane identification, and worked on various ML applications from image recognition to natural language integration. I'm particularly interested in the algorithms and statistics which make these systems work, from Gaussian Mixture Models to edge detection to Bayesian estimation.

I've spent years working in video production, which has given me a practical understanding of imaging techniques before I began studying computer vision formally. This experience has provided me with intuition to complement the mathematical and statistical methods I use in CV work. I also enjoy working with hardware, regularly combining software with physical components such as Raspberry Pis, microcontrollers, and other devices to build complete systems.

**Interests:** `Computer Vision`, `Signal Processing`, `Machine Learning`, `World History`, `Macroeconomics`, `Urban Planning`

**Hobbies:**
* Developing small, fun applications to make use of interesting technology, algorithms and techniques I've learned about
* Applying outside interests such as filmmaking to approach challenges in computing
* Experimenting with early emerging technologies such as LLMs
* Videography and filmmaking, including producing films on urban history and local government issues.
